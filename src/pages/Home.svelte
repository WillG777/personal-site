      <p>Hello there. I'm Will Giorza, a student at UC Berkeley majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. I've been interested in CS since middle school, and most of my experience so far is in web development. In my free time, I like hiking and reading sci-fi novels, and I'm a big fan of the Phoenix Suns and Everton Football Club.</p>
      <p>The best way to contact me is to message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-giorza-34006020a">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
