      <p>Hello there. I'm Will Giorza, a sophomore at UC Berkeley majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. I've been interested in CS since middle school, and most of my experience so far is in web development. In my free time, I like hiking and reading sci-fi novels, and I'm a big fan of the Phoenix Suns and Everton Football Club.</p>
