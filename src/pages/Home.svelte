      <p>Hello! I'm Will Giorza, an incoming software engineer at Duolingo and a recent graduate of UC Berkeley. I've been interested in CS since middle school, and I got my start in web development before working on full-stack projects. In my free time, I like hiking and reading sci-fi novels, and I'm a big fan of the Phoenix Suns and Everton Football Club.</p>
      <p>The best way to contact me is to message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willgiorza">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
