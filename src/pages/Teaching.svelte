  <h1>Teaching</h1>

  <p>One of my favorite parts of Berkeley is the undergrad teaching experience. </p>

  <h3>CS 61A tutor (Fall 2022)</h3>
  <p class="indent">As a tutor, I will be responsible for running small group sections and holding office hours.</p>
  <h3>CS 61A academic intern (Spring 2022)</h3>
  <p class="indent">As an AI, I worked in lab sections of 20-30 students once per week. My duties mainly consisted of helping answer debugging and conceptual questions to help students complete lab and homework assignments. I also worked with other AIs to give a mini-lecture on the Scheme language.</p>
